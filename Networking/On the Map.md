# On the Map

## MapKit Framework

### MKMapView
This is the view that displays a map.

### MKMapViewDelegate
The view controller conforms to this protocol to respond to pin taps.

### MKPointAnnotation
The class that is used to hold the data for the pins. The map view can be supplied with an array of annotation objects.

## Parse

Parse is a common solution used by mobile apps for persisting data in the cloud as an alternative to using Core Data.

### What is REST?
REpresentational State Transfer API (Twitter, Google, etc) - Works like a website does, make a call from a client to a server and you get data back over an HTTP protocol.
