## Getting data with HTTP

HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol

Protocol

* A way of communicating
* Standard operating procedure
* The rules for communication

Term | Description | 
:------------ | :-------------
NSURLSession class / object | API for downloading content via HTTP. Asynchronous, returns data to a completion handler block or custom delegate methods.
NSURLRequest object | Represents a URL load request. Encapsulates two basic data elements of a load request: 1) the URL to load 2) the policy to use when consulting the URL content cache made available by the implementation
NSURLSessionDataTask class | A data task returns data directly to the app (in memory) as one or more NSData objects
NSURLComponents class | Designed to parse URLs based on RFC 3986 and to construct URLs from their constituent parts. Create a URL components object: 1) from an NSString object that contains a URL 2) from an NSURL object 3) from scratch by using the default initializer

There are three types of configuration objects, there are similarly **three types of session**:

* *default sessions* - behave much like NSURLConnection
* *ephemeral sessions* - do not cache anything to disk
* *download sessions* - store the results in a file and continue transferring data even when your app is suspended, exits, or crashes.

Within those sessions, you can schedule three types of tasks: 

* *data tasks* - for retrieving data to memory
* *download tasks* - for downloading a file to disk
* *upload tasks* - for uploading a file from disk and receiving the response as data in memory

### HTTP GET Method

The HTTP GET method can be used to request data from a server using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). For example, if you wanted to get the data from this course's overview page, you would use the following request:

GET http://www.udacity.com/course/ud421

This request will return all the data associated with the course's overview page--including any images, scripts, and other data required to build the page.


This review will go over the commented sections in the ViewController.swift file:

```
/* 1 - Define constants */
let BASE_URL = "https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/"
let METHOD_NAME = "flickr.galleries.getPhotos"
let API_KEY = "ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
let GALLERY_ID = "5704-72157622566655097"
let EXTRAS = "url_m"
let DATA_FORMAT = "json"
let NO_JSON_CALLBACK = "1"
Here, we define some constants used in the app. Each of these constants are used to construct the URL of the HTTP GET request.

/* 2 - API method arguments */
let methodArguments = [
    "method": METHOD_NAME,
    "api_key": API_KEY,
    "gallery_id": GALLERY_ID,
    "extras": EXTRAS,
    "format": DATA_FORMAT,
    "nojsoncallback": NO_JSON_CALLBACK
]
[After the user presses the "Grab New Image" button] For convenience, we place the arguments used for the flickr.galleries.getPhotos method into a dictionary. This will be used by the escapedParameters() function.

/* 3 - Initialize session and url */
let session = NSURLSession.sharedSession()
let urlString = BASE_URL + escapedParameters(methodArguments)
let url = NSURL(string: urlString)!
let request = NSURLRequest(URL: url)
Now, we grab the singleton instance of NSURLSession and create the URL and an instance of NSURLRequest.

/* 4 - Initialize task for getting data */
let task = session.dataTaskWithRequest(request) { data, response, downloadError in
    // handle the response...
})
Using the session and request, we instantiate our task for grabbing an image from Flickr. The completion handler block is commented-out here, but this is where we will work with the response data.

/* 5 - Success! Parse the data */
var parsingError: NSError? = nil
let parsedResult: AnyObject! = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions.AllowFragments, error: &parsingError)
In the completion handler, we parse the JSON response data into something we can use -- we will cover this in more detail in Lesson 2.

/* 6 - Grab a single, random image */
let randomPhotoIndex = Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(photoArray.count)))
let photoDictionary = photoArray[randomPhotoIndex] as [String: AnyObject]
Since our request will return JSON for multiple images in gallery 5704-72157622566655097, we just grab one of the images.

/* 7 - Get the image url and title */
let photoTitle = photoDictionary["title"] as? String
let imageUrlString = photoDictionary["url_m"] as? String
let imageURL = NSURL(string: imageUrlString!)
Then, we grab the selected image's title and URL.

/* 8 - If an image exists at the url, set the image and title */
if let imageData = NSData(contentsOfURL: imageURL!) {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
        self.photoImageView.image = UIImage(data: imageData)
        self.photoTitle.text = photoTitle
    })
} else {
    println("Image does not exist at \(imageURL)")
}
If there is data at the URL, then we update the photoImageView and photoTitle!

/* 9 - Resume (execute) the task */
task.resume()
This actually runs/executes our request. Up to this point, all the previous steps just define what we should do when the request runs and completes.
```

## Lessons Learned

### Extra argument "key" in call error?

Adding "class" before the "substituteKeyInMethod" func helped the error. Previously, Xcode was highlighting "key: TMDBClient.URLKeys.UserID" to be the issue. The issue was that it appeared we were trying to call an instance method as a class method.

```
let parameters = [TMDBClient.ParameterKeys.SessionID: TMDBClient.sharedInstance().sessionID!]
var mutableMethod: String = Methods.AccountIDWatchlistMovies
mutableMethod = TMDBClient.substituteKeyInMethod(mutableMethod, key: TMDBClient.URLKeys.UserID, value: String(TMDBClient.sharedInstance().userID!))!
```

```
/* Helper: Substitute the key for the value that is contained within the method name */
class func substituteKeyInMethod(method: String, key: String, value: String) -> String? {
	if method.rangeOfString("{\(key)}") != nil {
		return method.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString("{\(key)}", withString: value)
   } else {
		return nil
	}
}
```

### What is a UIActivityIndicatorView?

An activity indicator shows that a task is in progress. An activity indicator appears as a "gear" that is either spinning or stopped.

### What is an NSMutableURLRequest?

NSMutableURLRequest is a subclass of NSURLRequest provided to aid developers who may find it more convenient to mutate a single request object for a series of URL load requests instead of creating an immutable NSURLRequest object for each load.

It has the addValue:forHTTPHeaderField: method

Term | Definition
:-----| :----
value	 | The value for the header field.
field	 | The name of the header field. In keeping with the HTTP RFC, HTTP header field names are case-insensitive.

### What is an HTTP header field?

"Content-type" is known as a MIME type that indicates what kind of data an HTTP response contains.

```
// Statement 1 is a MIME type for a response to a web form that has been filled in.
[request setValue:@"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"];

// Statement 2 is the MIME type for a standard HTML page which has a characterset of UTF-8 (basically, international support versus standard ASCII or something else).
[request setValue:@"text/html; charset=UTF-8" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"];

```

```
request.HTTPMethod = "POST"
request.addValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Accept")
request.addValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
request.HTTPBody = try! NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(jsonBody, options: .PrettyPrinted)
```

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#General_format>

### What does .PrettyPrinted mean?

NSJSONWritingPrettyPrinted
Specifies that the JSON data should be generated with whitespace designed to make the output more readable. If this option is not set, the most compact possible JSON representation is generated.

```
NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(jsonBody, options: .PrettyPrinted)
```

### What is the differene between HTTP post and HTTP get?

* GET - Requests data from a specified resource
* POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

### What is a network condition?
The latency and bandwidth of an Internet connection.

### What is Network Link Conditioner?
Network Link Conditioner is software from Apple that comes bundled with Hardware IO Tools. It can change the network environment of the iPhone Simulator according to built-in presets:

* EDGE
* 3G
* DSL
* WiFi
* High Latency DNS
* Very Bad Network
* 100% Loss

### What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

**Authentication** ensures someone's identity; another way of saying it might be "they are who they say they are"

**Authorization** provides someone access to do something; another way of saying it might be "they are allowed to do this action‚Äù

### What is OAuth?

An open standard for authorization that allows users to log into third parties (Google, Facebook, ...) to reduce the risk of access credentials being compromised
We will talk more about OAuth in the next lesson

### What is OpenID Connect?

An authentication layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol that allows clients to verify the identity of a user based on authentication performed by an authorization server
OpenID Connect can also be used to obtain basic profile information about a user in an interoperable and RESTful manner

### What are the general steps for making a networking request?

        /* 1. Set the parameters */
        /* 2. Build the URL */
        /* 3. Configure the request */
        /* 4. Make the request */
        /* 5. Parse the data */
        /* 6. Use the data! */
        /* 7. Start the request */

### What is Apple App Transport Security?

Apple now requires all HTTP requests to be made securely using HTTPS through ATS (Apple Transport Security). You can still, however, send HTTP (non-secure) requests if you configure ATS accordingly.

Introduced in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan
App Transport Security enforces best practices for secure network connections ‚Äî notably, TLS 1.2 and forward secrecy
App Transport Security is enabled by default when using NSURLSession, NSURLConnection, or CFURL in iOS 9 or OS X El Capitan. 

### Why would it be important to use HTTPS over HTTP?

Using HTTP requests means that anyone watching the networking traffic could potentially see the username and password being used as parameters with each login attempt. An application called Charles can enable you to see all the web traffic from your machine. An HTTPS call encrypts all the data being sent from the app.

### What is a UIWebView?

UIWebView - embed web content into your app. Can use this class to move forward and backward in web history. Can set some web content properties programmatically.

* Create UIWebView object
* Attach it to a window
* Send it a request to load web content

### What are collection types?

Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. 

* Arrays are ordered collections of values.
* Sets are unordered collections of unique values.
* Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

<https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html>

### What is a defer statement in Swift 2.0?

Rather than using nested if statements, a defer statement allows us to create a block that handles code that will be executed once execution leaves the current scope.

For example, this could be useful if we need to perform certain operations before deallocating memory. Defer can allow us to execute deallocation code no matter which exit point is used to return from the current function.

<http://nshipster.com/guard-and-defer/>

### What is a class cluster?

* Class clusters are a design pattern that the Foundation framework makes extensive use of. 
* Class clusters group a number of private concrete subclasses under a public abstract superclass. T
* Class clusters are based on the Abstract Factory design pattern.

Ex: To illustrate the class cluster architecture and its benefits, consider the problem of constructing a class hierarchy that defines objects to store numbers of different types (char, int, float, double). Because numbers of different types have many features in common (they can be converted from one type to another and can be represented as strings, for example), they could be represented by a single class. However, their storage requirements differ, so it‚Äôs inefficient to represent them all by the same class. 

![](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Art/cluster1.gif "Class cluster example")

### What is NSJSONSerialization?

You use the NSJSONSerialization class to convert JSON to Foundation objects and convert Foundation objects to JSON.

### What is NSJSONReadingAllowFragments?

Specifies that the parser should allow top-level objects that are not an instance of NSArray or NSDictionary.

`
NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: .AllowFragments)
`
### What is a fragment?
"Top-level" refers to the object in the JSON. Typically the top-level object in JSON is an array or dictionary, but in some cases the instance is neither. It could be an NSString, NSNumber, etc. The fragment is what JSON could be, meaning JSON could not be a whole dictionary with stuff in it but instead just a string.

### What is the difference between concrete subclass and subclass?

Looking up documentation, I often run into wording that says, ‚Äú[className] is a subclass of [className]‚Äù or ‚Äú[className] is a concrete subclass of [className]‚Äù so in this case I wondered the difference.

A concrete subclass is one you can instantiate.
If it‚Äôs not concrete, you can‚Äôt instantiate an object of that class.

In the case of NSURLSessionDataTask, they say it is concrete because it subclasses an abstract class (NSURLSessionTask).
NSHTTPURLResponse is already a concrete class because it subclasses a concrete class (NSURLResponse) which is also why they don‚Äôt mention it explicitly.

### Explain the steps for making a request.
NSURLSessionDataTask - Concrete subclass of NSURLSessionTask
The NSURLSessionTask class is the base class for tasks in a URL session. Tasks are always part of a session; you create a task by calling one of the task creation methods on an NSURLSession object. The method you call determines the type of task.

URL sessions provide three types of tasks: data tasks, upload tasks, and download tasks. These tasks are instances of the NSURLSessionDataTask, NSURLSessionUploadTask, and NSURLSessionDownloadTask subclasses of NSURLSessionTask, respectively.

* Data tasks request a resource, returning the server‚Äôs response as one or more NSData objects in memory. They are supported in default, ephemeral, and shared sessions, but are not supported in background sessions.
* Upload tasks are like data tasks, except that they make it easier to provide a request body so you can upload data before retrieving the server‚Äôs response. Additionally, upload tasks are supported in background sessions.
* Download tasks download a resource directly to a file on disk. Download tasks are supported in any type of session.

NSHTTPURLResponse, subclass of NSURLResponse
The NSHTTPURLResponse class is a subclass of NSURLResponse that provides methods for accessing information specific to HTTP protocol responses. Whenever you make HTTP URL load requests, any response objects you get back from the NSURLSession, NSURLConnection, or NSURLDownload class are instances of the NSHTTPURLResponse class.

NSURL, from the urlString / string of methodArguments
NSURLRequest

### What are 2XX codes?

2xx - 200 status codes mean success of some sort

Study these forever: <https://www.flickr.com/photos/girliemac/sets/72157628409467125/>

### When creating a new project in Xcode, can I use periods?

Project names with a ‚Äú.‚Äù turn into a dash. Okay.

### What does URI stand for?

Uniform Resource Identifier

### What is an NSURL?

In Foundation, URLs are represented by NSURL.

NSURL instances are created using the NSURL(string:) initializer:

If the string is not a valid URL, the initializer will return nil.

```
Objective-C
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äúhttp://example.com‚Äù];
```

```
Swift
let url = NSURL(string: ‚Äúhttp://example.com/‚Äú)
```

### Construct example URLs from a string relative to a base URL.

NSURL(string:relativeToURL:) - construct a URL from a string relative to a base URL. Be careful of leading /‚Äôs in relative paths.

```
Objective-C
NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äúhttp://example.com/v1/‚Äú];

[NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äúfoo‚Äù relativeToURL:baseURL];
// http://example.com/v1/foo

[NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äúfoo?bar=baz‚Äù relativeToURL:baseURL];
// http://example.com/v1/foo?bar=baz

[NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äú/foo‚Äù relativeToURL:baseURL];
// http://example.com/foo

[NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äúfoo/‚Äú relativeToURL:baseURL];
// http://example.com/v1/foo/

[NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äú/foo/‚Äú relativeToURL:baseURL];
// http://example.com/foo/

[NSURL URLWithString:@‚Äúhttp://example2.com/‚Äú relativeToURL:baseURL];
// http://example2.com/
```
```
Swift
let baseURL = NSURL(string: ‚Äúhttp://example.com/v1/‚Äú)

NSURL(string: ‚Äúfoo‚Äù, relativeToURL:baseURL)
NSURL(string: ‚Äúfoo?bar=baz‚Äù, relativeToURL:baseURL)
NSURL(string: ‚Äú/foo‚Äù, relativeToURL:baseURL)
NSURL(string: ‚Äúfoo/‚Äú, relativeToURL:baseURL)
NSURL(string: ‚Äú/foo/‚Äú, relativeToURL:baseURL)
NSURL(string: ‚Äúhttp://example2.com/‚Äú, relativeToURL:baseURL)
```

### What is the difference between NSURL and NSURLComponents?

The difference here, between NSURL and NSURLComponents, is that component properties are read-write. This provides a safe and direct way to modify individual components of a URL:

* scheme
* user
* password
* host
* port
* path
* query
* fragment

Quietly added in iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks was NSURLComponents, which can best be described by what it could have been named instead: NSMutableURL.

Although username & password can be stored in a URL, consider using NSURLCredential when representing user credentials, or persisting them to the keychain.

### How do you add Percent-Encoding?

```
Objective-C
NSString *title = @‚ÄúNSURL / NSURLComponents‚Äù;
NSString *escapedTitle = [title stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters:[NSCharacterSet URLQueryAllowedCharacterSet]];
components.query = [NSSTring stringWithFormat:@‚Äútitle=%@‚Äú, escapedTitle];
```
```
Swift
let title = ‚ÄúNSURL / NSURLComponents‚Äù
if let escapedTitle = title.stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters(NSCharacterSet.URLQueryAllowedCharacterSet()) {
	components.query = ‚Äútitle=\(escapedTitle)‚Äù
}
```

### What is a File Descriptor?
In simple words, when you open a file, the operating system creates an entry to represent that file and store the information about that opened file. So if there are 100 files opened in your OS then there will be 100 entries in OS (somewhere in kernel). These entries are represented by integers like (...100, 101, 102....). This entry number is the file descriptor. So it is just an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in operating system. If your process opens 10 files then your Process table will have 10 entries for file descriptors.

Similarly when you open a network socket, it is also represented by an integer and it is called Socket Descriptor. I hope you understand.
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5256599/what-are-file-descriptors-explained-in-simple-terms>

Hear it from the Horse's Mouth : APUE (Richard Stevens).
To the kernel, all open files are referred to by File Descriptors. A file descriptor is a non-negative number.
When we open an existing file or create a new file, the kernel returns a file descriptor to the process. The kernel maintains a table of all open file descriptors, which are in use. The allotment of file descriptors is generally sequential and they are alloted to the file as the next free file descriptor from the pool of free file descriptors. When we closes the file, the file descriptor gets freed and is available for further allotment.
See this image for more details :
http://lh6.ggpht.com/honestyhuang/SGTZuft4tXI/AAAAAAAAAmA/JBqgZq2dBAU/s800/two%20process%20same%20file.jpg

When we want to read or write a file, we identify the file with the file descriptor that was returned by open() or create() function call, and use it as an argument to either read() or write().
It is by convention that, UNIX System shells associates the file descriptor 0 with Standard Input of a process, file descriptor 1 with Standard Output, and file desciptor 2 with Standard Error.
File descriptor ranges from 0 to OPEN_MAX.
For more information, go through 3rd chapter of APUE Book.
