### What is causing the SwifferApp to show offsets?

It seemed to be running on 3.5inch mode no matter what. Because there was no default Launch Screen File set, the app would scale back once it launched, causing the view to not take up the entire space. Once I defaulted Launch Screen File set to “Storyboard” it worked.
